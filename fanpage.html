        <p>
          Sonia Sotomayor was born to Puerto Rican parents in the Bronx. She
          attended Princeton on a full schalorship due, in part, to affirmative
          action. She put in long hours of study because she did not fit in with
          the mostly white, upper-class student body. Her writing skills and
          vocabulary were not very good and she did not ask any questions her
          freshman year for fear of embarrassing herself. A professor helped her
          after hours and she gained skills, knowledge, and confidence. <br />
          Sotomayor was an advocate for other students and faculty. There were
          no full-time Latino faculty at Princeton so she met with the
          university president, but saw no results. She went on to file a formal
          letter of complaint and the university began to hire Latino faculty.
          She worked with a history professor to start a Puerto Rican history
          and politics seminar. <br />
          In 1976, Sotomayor graduated with high honors.

        <h2>Yale Law School</h2>
        <p>
          Sonia Sotomayor was an activist throughout her academic career for
          other hispanic students and faculty. She was known as a hard worker,
          but not considered a start student in her class. During a recruiting
          dinner, a representative of a famous D.C. lawfirm suggested that she
          was only at Yale due to affirmative action. She filed a letter of
          complaint and did not accept a job offer with the firm. Her actions
          sparked a campus-wide debate. The firm's subsequent apology was
          published in the Washington Post.

        <h2>Supreme Court</h2>
        <p>
          New York Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand jointly urged
          President Obama to nominate Sotomayor to the position of Supreme Court
          Justice. She became only the second jurist to be nominated to three
          different judicial positions by three different presidents after Obama
          awarded her the nomination. <br />
          Sotomayor's first case was the controversial Citizens United v.
          Federal Election. <br />
          <i>
            "What you are suggesting is that the courts, who created
            corporations as persons, gave birth to corporations as persons, and
            there could be an argument made that that was the Court's error to
            start with ... [imbuing] a creature of State law with human
            characteristics." </i
          ><br />
          She dissented to the ruling that famously treated corporations as
          persons. <br />
          By the end of her fifth year on the court, Sotomayor had become
          especially visible in oral arguments and in passionate dissents from
          various majority rulings, especially those involving issues of race,
          gender and ethnic identity.
